### Reflection
The system prompt tells the AI how to talk to users and format responses with summaries, tables, and tips. The reference file is the behind-the-scenes instruction manual with four modules handling data collection, planning logic, quality checks, and output formatting. GitHub lets our team work together by tracking every change, creating separate branches to test ideas without breaking the main project, and merging improvements safely. Breaking the planner into modules makes it easier to fix or upgrade one part without affecting everything else. This workflow mirrors real software development where teams collaborate on complex projects systematically.
